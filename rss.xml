This was kind of rushed too. On with the teardown!

<p>The following picture is from the manufacturer, Mid-Continent Instrument's website. It shows what the lights on the front say. It also lists a retail price of $862.00, and suggests it is designed for 28 volts and for use with a BendixKing KLN 89B. It looks like an older GPS with a nice orange VFD display.</p>

<p>For teardown today we have an aircraft annunciator. In casual terms, an annunciator is the big panel in the cockpit that has all of the warning and problem lights. I am not a pilot but will try to explain. The left button allows you to switch the source of information on one of the instruments. The source switches between the current GPS location/course, which is from a dedicated box on the panel, or NAV which is output from the plane's radio and is transmitted by a ground station. The signal gets stronger or weaker depending where the ground station is relative to the directional antenna. These 2 sources for positional info are selected between to be displayed on a HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator) or a CDI (Course Deviation Indicator). The aircraft would have either or of these. The point is the aircraft only has one course display and two possible sources of information. <a href="https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/26031/what-are-the-differences-between-an-obs-a-cdi-a-heading-indicator-and-an-hsi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is a great article</a> explaining the difference between HSI and CDI. I am not clear on the right button. I think it sets the GPS into "Approach Mode". The MSG and WPT lights will illuminate when the GPS has an alert on it about either Message or Waypoints. Not sure about HSI, maybe the HSI needs attention?</p>

<p>The connector is a D-Sub 25 made made by Positronic. Exactly half the pins are populated. It does not show up well on camera. The connector has a weird release mechanism. It has hooks on one side and a sprung lever that pushes inward.</p>

<p>Now finally the teardown. The top side just has the incandescent rice lights and some big current limiting resistors. The bottom side has the light for the buttons and protection diodes for the warning lights, as well as the relays the buttons control.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/16jalayt/Grasshopper-DesignStudio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This blog post</a> details how to keep older Cricut machines working with a computer.</p>
<p>This is a decompilation and improvement of Provo Craft's Cricut DesignStudio. All rights and copyright goes to them. However, they have not supported the software since at least 2013, thus is considered abandonware. The first and second generation Cricut machines are no longer supported and no longer work with any supported software. This repo is an attempt to keep older Cricut machines working and out of landfills.</p>
<p>The software has been decompiled with ILSpy and rebuilt with newer versions of .net. The original program was .net 2.0, and the versions provided are .net 4.7 and 4.8. Choose 4.7 for Windows 7 and 4.8 for Windows 10 and 11.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="installation">Installation<a href="https://16jalayt.github.io/cricut-designStudio#installation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Installation" title="Direct link to Installation">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/16jalayt/Grasshopper-DesignStudio/releases/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Releases here</a> and download the version for your operating system. Only the new binary is provided. You need the original program installer to use. It is available on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510081648/http://mirror.cricut.com/cds/fontpack/CDS_10404220.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayback Machine</a>.
You can either install the software or extract the installer with <a href="https://github.com/Bioruebe/UniExtract2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Extractor</a> or <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7Zip</a>.
Overwrite the executable with the version from this repository.</p>
<p>There is also a font update that is available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915110352/http://www.cricut.com/home/support/CDS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> under "Cartridge update 1", but I couldn't get it to install on Windows 10, so i'm not sure what the changes are. "Cartridge Update 2" was not archived and is presumed lost.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="alternatives">Alternatives<a href="https://16jalayt.github.io/cricut-designStudio#alternatives" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alternatives" title="Direct link to Alternatives">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Other software works too. One is the other Cricut original software called Cricut Craft Room. It runs on Adobe Air (Flash). Craft Room is dependent on the internet, however, and is unusable as the servers have been shut down. I have looked into patching this version, and it is beyond my ability right now. If anyone wants to try, <a href="https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler</a> works well to view and edit any Flash or Air file.</p>
<p>The other alternative is <a href="https://surecutsalot.com/software/software_scal.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sure Cuts A Lot</a> currently at version 6. Version 2 is the last one to support Cricut, but is no longer for sale. I got a hold of a copy, but it would'nt work for me. SCAL can trace images or import SVG files. There is a community plugin for version 4 and up called <a href="https://github.com/DThunder1000/libcutter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libcutter</a>. I have confirmed this working. It should work with Cricut Personal, Expression, and Create.
To install, run SCAL once to generate folders. There should now be a folder in your documents folder called "SCALCutPlugins". Copy all the files in libcutter/Windows/Build/ to SCALCutPlugins. You will also need a file that I am not allowed to distribute. It is available from the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130727005222/http://www.built-to-spec.com/files/keys.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayback Machine</a>. This file should be renamed to "keys.h" and placed in that folder also. Inside the software you have to go cutters -&gt; My Cutters -&gt; Manage Cutters. Under Company/Brand select Cricut. Under model, select the only option showing the models supported by libcutter. Click Add to List and it should be ready to go!</p>

<p>There is a large section of unpopulated BGA and QFP packages on the left. It is possible a different model had Wi-Fi built in. There is sort of a punch out in the back of the case for an antenna. Notice how there is also no solder mask around what would be the RF section on the left. There is also what looks like a JTAG connector on the bottom right.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure what the USB port did. It wasn't like newer routers with the media device server. I think you could plug it directly into a computer to get internet instead of ethernet. I remember it came with one of those ubiquitous blue USB type B cables. Also a mold mark closeup for those who care...</p>

<p>I didn't know what this was beforehand. They are called Jordan Spreaders. They were originally used to spread ballast along the tracks, but are also used to plow snow. Here is the Wikipedia link if you want the full history: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreader_(railroad)"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreader_(railroad)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreader_(railroad)</a>. The pictures below are much better views of what spreaders look like with lots of retractable blades.</p>
