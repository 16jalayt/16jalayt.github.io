Today I have a Bendix King KLN-88 Loran. It comes in a briefcase for "take-home mode", so you can program in your routes at home because it is kind of complicated. It makes a good educational tool too.

The Briefcase is nice fake leather (probably PU). The corners have actual stitching. There are keys provided, but they don't fit the lock.
