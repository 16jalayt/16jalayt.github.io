TODO: put contact in footer and mention in article

My first post of 2024. I want to preface this with the fact that I got a photo studio box and a new camera (Sony A6000), so I am still learning the process. This was kind of rushed too. On with the teardown!

The following picture is from the manufacturer, Mid-Continent Instrument's website. It shows what the lights on the front say. It also lists a retail price of $862.00, and suggests it is designed for 28 volts and for use with a BendixKing KLN 89B. It looks like an older GPS with a nice orange VFD display.

For teardown today we have an aircraft annunciator. In casual terms, an annunciator is the big panel in the cockpit that has all of the warning and problem lights. I am not a pilot but will try to explain. The left button allows you to switch the source of information on one of the instruments. The source switches between the current GPS location/course, which is from a dedicated box on the panel, or NAV which is output from the plane's radio and is transmitted by a ground station. The signal gets stronger or weaker depending where the ground station is relative to the directional antenna. These 2 sources for positional info are selected between to be displayed on a HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator) or a CDI (Course Deviation Indicator). The aircraft would have either or of these. The point is the aircraft only has one course display and two possible sources of information. [This is a great article](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/26031/what-are-the-differences-between-an-obs-a-cdi-a-heading-indicator-and-an-hsi) explaining the difference between HSI and CDI. I am not clear on the right button. I think it sets the GPS into "Approach Mode". The MSG and WPT lights will illuminate when the GPS has an alert on it about either Message or Waypoints. Not sure about HSI, maybe the HSI needs attention?

The connector is a D-Sub 25 made made by Positronic. Exactly half the pins are populated. It does not show up well on camera. The connector has a weird release mechanism. It has hooks on one side and a sprung lever that pushes inward.

Now finally the teardown. The top side just has the incandescent rice lights and some big current limiting resistors. The bottom side has the light for the buttons and protection diodes for the warning lights, as well as the relays the buttons control.
