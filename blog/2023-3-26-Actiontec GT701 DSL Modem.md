This was my families' first DSL modem circa 2009. Quest was apparently a nation wide ISP (I was very young). They were bought out by Century Link. The OEM of their equipment was and still is Actiontec.

There is a large section of unpopulated BGA and QFP packages on the left. It is possible a different model had Wi-Fi built in. There is sort of a punch out in the back of the case for an antenna. Notice how there is also no solder mask around what would be the RF section on the left. There is also what looks like a JTAG connector on the bottom right.

One of the capacitors doesn't look so good.

I'm not entirely sure what the USB port did. It wasn't like newer routers with the media device server. I think you could plug it directly into a computer to get internet instead of ethernet. I remember it came with one of those ubiquitous blue USB type B cables. Also a mold mark closeup for those who care...
