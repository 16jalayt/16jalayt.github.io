It is possible a different model had Wi-Fi built in. There is sort of a punch out in the back of the case for an antenna. Notice how there is also no solder mask around what would be the RF section on the left. There is also what looks like a JTAG connector on the bottom right.\\n\\n<Image src=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52773134335_6508d84281_c_d.jpg\\" \\nhref=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52773134335_4fd542072f_o_d.jpg\\"\\nflkr=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/52773134335/\\"/>\\n\\n<Image src=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52773203048_a267f36e15_c_d.jpg\\" \\nhref=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52773203048_a4e75d6909_o_d.jpg\\"\\nflkr=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/52773203048/\\"/>\\n\\nOne of the capacitors doesn\'t look so good.\\n\\n<Image src=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52773200253_331c44aa2d_c_d.jpg\\" \\nhref=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52773200253_d90bfba5f6_o_d.jpg\\"\\nflkr=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/52773200253\\"/>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<Image src=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52772185207_480ef6a4b3_c_d.jpg\\" \\nhref=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52772185207_30e356d2c0_o_d.jpg\\"\\nflkr=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/52772185207\\"/>\\n\\n\\n<Image src=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52773131625_4c6bb2a826_c_d.jpg\\" \\nhref=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52773131625_bc11cf37d0_o_d.jpg\\"\\nflkr=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/52773131625\\"/>\\n\\nI\'m not entirely sure what the USB port did.
