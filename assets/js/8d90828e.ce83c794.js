There is a loop of wire run through the head of a screw. The wire is run around the corner, through another screw and the two ends are held together with a chunk of squished metal. They probably heat a slug of metal (lead?) with an induction heater and then crimp it on the wire. Something similar is done all over the place on aircraft, called safety wire. The purpose is to prevent screws from backing out due to vibration. It is usually used for structural elements. The ends are usually just twisted together instead of using the slug. The fact that they lock the end definitely means that this is for anti-tamper."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(o.A,{src:"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54092942663_0713edf3a1_b.jpg",href:"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54092942663_b711046fba_o.jpg",link:"https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/54092942663"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(o.A,{src:"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54093024594_beff38c093_b.jpg",href:"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54093024594_766d587073_o.jpg",link:"https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/54093024594"}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(e.p,{children:["This monitor is made up of 2 boards. The processor board and the interface board. The interface board contains the single connector to the outside, which is a standard male db-9 that also happens to carry rs-232 in a nonstandard pinout. The pinout is custom because it also carries power as well as the transducer inputs. There is a ubiquitous MAX232 to handle output. The pins on the right connect to the display board, which is a pain to get realigned when reassembling. You have to unscrew the front plate, attach the boards, feed through the case, then reattach the front. Very unintuitive. You can see in the detail shots below, there is a fiberglass sheet to prevent the boards from shorting to the case. There is also a opamp with a trimpot. This would likely be handling the transducer input. I have not looked into how the transducers work, although this unit supposedly handles two transducers with a single opamp?
