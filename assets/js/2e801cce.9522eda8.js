It shows what the lights on the front say. It also lists a retail price of $862.00, and suggests it is designed for 28 volts and for use with a BendixKing KLN 89B. It looks like an older GPS with a nice orange VFD display.\\n\\n<Image src=\\"https://www.mcico.com/media/catalog/product/m/d/md41-229_2.png?optimize=medium&fit=bounds&height=461&width=461&canvas=461:461\\"\\nhref=\\"https://www.mcico.com/media/catalog/product/m/d/md41-229_2.png?optimize=medium&fit=bounds&height=461&width=461&canvas=461:461\\"\\nlink=\\"https://www.mcico.com/annunciation-control-units/md41-229\\"\\nsubText=\\"Link to Manufacturer\'s Website\\"/>\\n\\n[Datasheet from Similar Model](https://assets.mcico.com/assets/products/InstallationManuals/MD41-140X_141X_im.pdf)\\n\\nFor teardown today we have an aircraft annunciator. In casual terms, an annunciator is the big panel in the cockpit that has all of the warning and problem lights. I am not a pilot but will try to explain. The left button allows you to switch the source of information on one of the instruments. The source switches between the current GPS location/course, which is from a dedicated box on the panel, or NAV which is output from the plane\'s radio and is transmitted by a ground station. The signal gets stronger or weaker depending where the ground station is relative to the directional antenna. These 2 sources for positional info are selected between to be displayed on a HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator) or a CDI (Course Deviation Indicator). The aircraft would have either or of these. The point is the aircraft only has one course display and two possible sources of information. [This is a great article](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/26031/what-are-the-differences-between-an-obs-a-cdi-a-heading-indicator-and-an-hsi) explaining the difference between HSI and CDI. I am not clear on the right button. I think it sets the GPS into \\"Approach Mode\\". The MSG and WPT lights will illuminate when the GPS has an alert on it about either Message or Waypoints. Not sure about HSI, maybe the HSI needs attention?\\n\\n<Image src=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53529116902_62115c0776_c.jpg\\"\\nhref=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53529116902_51d1a8b7fa_o.jpg\\"\\nlink=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/53529116902/\\"/>\\n\\n<Image src=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53530011116_95f192dcfc_c.jpg\\"\\nhref=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53530011116_55c490da2a_o.jpg\\"\\nlink=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/53530011116/\\"/>\\n\\nThe connector is a D-Sub 25 made made by Positronic. Exactly half the pins are populated. It does not show up well on camera. The connector has a weird release mechanism. It has hooks on one side and a sprung lever that pushes inward.\\n\\n<Image src=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53530440825_12a8ccaf68_c.jpg\\"\\nhref=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53530440825_f1546fa010_o.jpg\\"\\nlink=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/53530440825/\\"/>\\n\\n<Image src=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53530200328_e768591e1a_c.jpg\\"\\nhref=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53530200328_a20f6aa1bb_o.jpg\\"\\nlink=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/53530200328\\"/>\\n\\n<Image src=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53530200093_d62ed3c55c_c.jpg\\"\\nhref=\\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53530200093_2841d58890_o.jpg\\"\\nlink=\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/53530200093/\\"/>\\n\\nNow finally the teardown.

All rights and copyright goes to them. However, they have not supported the software since at least 2013, thus is considered abandonware. The first and second generation Cricut machines are no longer supported and no longer work with any supported software. This repo is an attempt to keep older Cricut machines working and out of landfills.\\n\\nThe software has been decompiled with ILSpy and rebuilt with newer versions of .net. The original program was .net 2.0, and the versions provided are .net 4.7 and 4.8. Choose 4.7 for Windows 7 and 4.8 for Windows 10 and 11.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nGo to [Releases here](https://github.com/16jalayt/Grasshopper-DesignStudio/releases/latest) and download the version for your operating system. Only the new binary is provided. You need the original program installer to use. It is available on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20130510081648/http://mirror.cricut.com/cds/fontpack/CDS_10404220.exe).\\nYou can either install the software or extract the installer with [Universal Extractor](https://github.com/Bioruebe/UniExtract2) or [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).\\nOverwrite the executable with the version from this repository.\\n\\nThere is also a font update that is available [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20130915110352/http://www.cricut.com/home/support/CDS) under \\"Cartridge update 1\\", but I couldn\'t get it to install on Windows 10, so i\'m not sure what the changes are. \\"Cartridge Update 2\\" was not archived and is presumed lost.\\n\\n## Alternatives\\n\\nOther software works too. One is the other Cricut original software called Cricut Craft Room. It runs on Adobe Air (Flash). Craft Room is dependent on the internet, however, and is unusable as the servers have been shut down. I have looked into patching this version, and it is beyond my ability right now. If anyone wants to try, [JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler) works well to view and edit any Flash or Air file.\\n\\nThe other alternative is [Sure Cuts A Lot](https://surecutsalot.com/software/software_scal.php) currently at version 6. Version 2 is the last one to support Cricut, but is no longer for sale. I got a hold of a copy, but it would\'nt work for me. SCAL can trace images or import SVG files. There is a community plugin for version 4 and up called [libcutter](https://github.com/DThunder1000/libcutter). I have confirmed this working. It should work with Cricut Personal, Expression, and Create.\\nTo install, run SCAL once to generate folders. There should now be a folder in your documents folder called \\"SCALCutPlugins\\". Copy all the files in libcutter/Windows/Build/ to SCALCutPlugins. You will also need a file that I am not allowed to distribute. It is available from the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20130727005222/http://www.built-to-spec.com/files/keys.txt). This file should be renamed to \\"keys.h\\" and placed in that folder also. Inside the software you have to go cutters -> My Cutters -> Manage Cutters. Under Company/Brand select Cricut. Under model, select the only option showing the models supported by libcutter. Click Add to List and it should be ready to go!\\n\\n![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=16jalayt.cricut-designStudio)"},{"id":"gt701-modem","metadata":{"permalink":"/gt701-modem","source":"@site/blog/2023-3-26-Actiontec GT701 DSL Modem.md","title":"Actiontec GT701 DSL Modem","description":"This was my families\' first DSL modem circa 2009.
