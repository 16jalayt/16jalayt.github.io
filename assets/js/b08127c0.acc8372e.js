In casual terms, an annunciator is the big panel in the cockpit that has all of the warning and problem lights. I am not a pilot but will try to explain. The left button allows you to switch the source of information on one of the instruments. The source switches between the current GPS location/course, which is from a dedicated box on the panel, or NAV which is output from the plane's radio and is transmitted by a ground station. The signal gets stronger or weaker depending where the ground station is relative to the directional antenna. These 2 sources for positional info are selected between to be displayed on a HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator) or a CDI (Course Deviation Indicator). The aircraft would have either or of these. The point is the aircraft only has one course display and two possible sources of information.
