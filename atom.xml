<p>The part I received is only the front panel from the original radar, so I don't have a model number or any other info about the original part. The display board that was used to replace the original CRT is a kyv-n2 v1. This board is available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NJYTouch-Controller-5-6inch-AT056TN53-640x480/dp/B081WSFSWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> for $32. I do not know where the sourced the LCD panel, but that was obtained separately. The panel was hot glued to the frame with a layer of thin foam insulating the back of the panel from the board.</p>

<p>There is then a layer of packing tape on top, I assume to prevent shorting. There was originally a Teensy++ 2.0 hot glued between the panel and the switches at the bottom. Most of the connections were severed when I received it, and with no documentation for pinout or a way to dump the micro, I just completely removed it and will have to start over.</p>

<p>The control assembly is completely separate. There is the button board, and the knobs. There originally would have been another board that would take the inputs and converts it to ARINC 429 (airplane equivalent of CAN bus or rs232) or something similar to be sent to the radar unit. There is lighting under the faceplate as well as inside each button. The faceplate material has a core that is translucent and is painted grey. This is to allow the knobs and lettering to glow slightly. This would have been very dim as the lighting is 5V incandescent lamps.</p>

<p>This is not the original back plate, but a mid plate. It secures the button board to the back of the front plate. We can see the original manufacturer is Honeywell. Spectra Lux makes both lighting and avionics. Not sure if they were the designer, or if that is who makes the lamps. This panel was made in 1991, and the lights are 5V. I am also not sure if this was the original part to go with the radar, or if they are from separate sources.</p>
<div class="sc-blHHSb cmzjAN"><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54055181679_0fde114d67_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54055181679_98938ab602_b.jpg" alt="Unhelpful generic description of an image." class="sc-gtLWhw hzTZPg"></a><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/54055181679"> <!-- -->Uploaded to Flickr<!-- --> </a></div>
<p>This is the cable that comes out the back of the previous assembly and would go to the missing board with the controller. It is a 2x15 DuPont style header. This part was converted for simulator use. There is a section of cut CAT5e cable coming from it. I don't know what micro they were using in the simulator. It seems like there are only enough wires in the ethernet to detect each of the 8 button presses. The way they connected the header to CAT5 was to strip the wires and then shove them inside the header. A "generous" amount of hot glue is all that keeps them in place. One of the wires seems to be broken. I was tracing the pinout, and I can't find continuity anywhere.</p>
<div class="sc-blHHSb cmzjAN"><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54053991477_988e6f8152_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54053991477_c31a14c105_b.jpg" alt="Unhelpful generic description of an image." class="sc-gtLWhw hzTZPg"></a><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/54053991477"> <!-- -->Uploaded to Flickr<!-- --> </a></div>
<p>This is the midplate. It is the main mount. The weird flatheads are what screws into the AV rack. The button assembly affixes by the two screw holes in the middle.</p>
<div class="sc-blHHSb cmzjAN"><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54054861466_f854592ccf_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54054861466_a2bd074e5b_b.jpg" alt="Unhelpful generic description of an image." class="sc-gtLWhw hzTZPg"></a><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/193261163@N03/54054861466"> <!-- -->Uploaded to Flickr<!-- --> </a></div>
<p>The back side shows the two trimpots that control brightness and sensitivity as well as the selector switch, which the wires broke off of. The plate seems to be CNCd from a block of material, possibly brass? The fact that it was CNCd in 1991 is kind of impressive as that was a lot less common back then. It would have been expensive. The picture isn't as in focus as I would like, but you can still see tool marks on the interior. Based on the shape, the same piece may have been used for multiple avionics.</p>

<p>The buttons have a spot for the lamp to shine through and illuminate the word "ON".</p>

<p>There are 2 lamps per button and some others scattered around. There is a very nice looking photo cell in the top leftish of the board. This would change the lighting brightness based on how dark it is. Most avionics have this.</p>

<p>One interesting feature that this device has that I have never seen on any other avionic is an anti tamper tag. There is a loop of wire run through the head of a screw. The wire is run around the corner, through another screw and the two ends are held together with a chunk of squished metal. They probably heat a slug of metal (lead?) with an induction heater and then crimp it on the wire. Something similar is done all over the place on aircraft, called safety wire. The purpose is to prevent screws from backing out due to vibration. It is usually used for structural elements. The ends are usually just twisted together instead of using the slug. The fact that they lock the end definitely means that this is for anti-tamper.</p>

<p>This monitor is made up of 2 boards. The processor board and the interface board. The interface board contains the single connector to the outside, which is a standard male db-9 that also happens to carry rs-232 in a nonstandard pinout. The pinout is custom because it also carries power as well as the transducer inputs. There is a ubiquitous MAX232 to handle output. The pins on the right connect to the display board, which is a pain to get realigned when reassembling. You have to unscrew the front plate, attach the boards, feed through the case, then reattach the front. Very unintuitive. You can see in the detail shots below, there is a fiberglass sheet to prevent the boards from shorting to the case. There is also a opamp with a trimpot. This would likely be handling the transducer input. I have not looked into how the transducers work, although this unit supposedly handles two transducers with a single opamp? The datasheet for the opamp is <a href="https://16jalayt.github.io/assets/files/LM207-076406c811ca7d1b89452be0c8ce2cbb.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a> There is also a single bodge, an extra diode. You can see in the detail shots below, there is a standoff with one end glued to the CPU board. It is not hot glue, but some sort of flexible epoxy like the stuff you use for weather sealing................ chips</p>

<p>The CPU board has all the bits you need on it. The board says: "Processor Board (Intel)". This implies other CPU boards were designed. They probably used the same processor boards in other products. The CPU is an MHS 80C32. <a href="https://16jalayt.github.io/assets/files/80C32_Family-43eba6e4589448321f8a1dc52f069b71.pdf" target="_blank">Datasheet</a>. This is an 8051 with 256K onboard RAM.

<p>The display just uses standard 7 segment displays. There is a button, two switches and a photo cell in a gold plated can. Most avionics have this for auto dimming. The driver ICs are MC75491P. The datasheet is <a href="https://16jalayt.github.io/assets/files/MC75491-1e7a55b512e25c427f41fad0d2885742.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>. They just appear to be just 4 high current transistors in a dip package designed for driving LEDs.</p>]]></content>

<p>The following picture is from the manufacturer, Mid-Continent Instrument's website. It shows what the lights on the front say. It also lists a retail price of $862.00, and suggests it is designed for 28 volts and for use with a BendixKing KLN 89B. It looks like an older GPS with a nice orange VFD display.</p>

<p>For teardown today we have an aircraft annunciator. In casual terms, an annunciator is the big panel in the cockpit that has all of the warning and problem lights. I am not a pilot but will try to explain. The left button allows you to switch the source of information on one of the instruments. The source switches between the current GPS location/course, which is from a dedicated box on the panel, or NAV which is output from the plane's radio and is transmitted by a ground station. The signal gets stronger or weaker depending where the ground station is relative to the directional antenna. These 2 sources for positional info are selected between to be displayed on a HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator) or a CDI (Course Deviation Indicator). The aircraft would have either or of these. The point is the aircraft only has one course display and two possible sources of information. <a href="https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/26031/what-are-the-differences-between-an-obs-a-cdi-a-heading-indicator-and-an-hsi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is a great article</a> explaining the difference between HSI and CDI. I am not clear on the right button. I think it sets the GPS into "Approach Mode". The MSG and WPT lights will illuminate when the GPS has an alert on it about either Message or Waypoints. Not sure about HSI, maybe the HSI needs attention?</p>

<p>The connector is a D-Sub 25 made made by Positronic. Exactly half the pins are populated. It does not show up well on camera. The connector has a weird release mechanism. It has hooks on one side and a sprung lever that pushes inward.</p>

<p>Now finally the teardown. The top side just has the incandescent rice lights and some big current limiting resistors. The bottom side has the light for the buttons and protection diodes for the warning lights, as well as the relays the buttons control.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/16jalayt/Grasshopper-DesignStudio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This blog post</a> details how to keep older Cricut machines working with a computer.</p>
<p>This is a decompilation and improvement of Provo Craft's Cricut DesignStudio. All rights and copyright goes to them. However, they have not supported the software since at least 2013, thus is considered abandonware. The first and second generation Cricut machines are no longer supported and no longer work with any supported software. This repo is an attempt to keep older Cricut machines working and out of landfills.</p>
<p>The software has been decompiled with ILSpy and rebuilt with newer versions of .net. The original program was .net 2.0, and the versions provided are .net 4.7 and 4.8. Choose 4.7 for Windows 7 and 4.8 for Windows 10 and 11.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="installation">Installation<a href="https://16jalayt.github.io/cricut-designStudio#installation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Installation" title="Direct link to Installation">​</a></h2>
<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/16jalayt/Grasshopper-DesignStudio/releases/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Releases here</a> and download the version for your operating system. Only the new binary is provided. You need the original program installer to use. It is available on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510081648/http://mirror.cricut.com/cds/fontpack/CDS_10404220.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayback Machine</a>.
You can either install the software or extract the installer with <a href="https://github.com/Bioruebe/UniExtract2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Extractor</a> or <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7Zip</a>.
Overwrite the executable with the version from this repository.</p>
<p>There is also a font update that is available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915110352/http://www.cricut.com/home/support/CDS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> under "Cartridge update 1", but I couldn't get it to install on Windows 10, so i'm not sure what the changes are. "Cartridge Update 2" was not archived and is presumed lost.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="alternatives">Alternatives<a href="https://16jalayt.github.io/cricut-designStudio#alternatives" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alternatives" title="Direct link to Alternatives">​</a></h2>
<p>Other software works too. One is the other Cricut original software called Cricut Craft Room. It runs on Adobe Air (Flash). Craft Room is dependent on the internet, however, and is unusable as the servers have been shut down. I have looked into patching this version, and it is beyond my ability right now. If anyone wants to try, <a href="https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler</a> works well to view and edit any Flash or Air file.</p>
<p>The other alternative is <a href="https://surecutsalot.com/software/software_scal.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sure Cuts A Lot</a> currently at version 6. Version 2 is the last one to support Cricut, but is no longer for sale. I got a hold of a copy, but it would'nt work for me. SCAL can trace images or import SVG files. There is a community plugin for version 4 and up called <a href="https://github.com/DThunder1000/libcutter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libcutter</a>. I have confirmed this working. It should work with Cricut Personal, Expression, and Create.
To install, run SCAL once to generate folders. There should now be a folder in your documents folder called "SCALCutPlugins". Copy all the files in libcutter/Windows/Build/ to SCALCutPlugins. You will also need a file that I am not allowed to distribute. It is available from the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130727005222/http://www.built-to-spec.com/files/keys.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayback Machine</a>. This file should be renamed to "keys.h" and placed in that folder also. Inside the software you have to go cutters -&gt; My Cutters -&gt; Manage Cutters. Under Company/Brand select Cricut. Under model, select the only option showing the models supported by libcutter. Click Add to List and it should be ready to go!</p>

<p>There is a large section of unpopulated BGA and QFP packages on the left. It is possible a different model had Wi-Fi built in. There is sort of a punch out in the back of the case for an antenna. Notice how there is also no solder mask around what would be the RF section on the left. There is also what looks like a JTAG connector on the bottom right.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure what the USB port did. It wasn't like newer routers with the media device server. I think you could plug it directly into a computer to get internet instead of ethernet. I remember it came with one of those ubiquitous blue USB type B cables. Also a mold mark closeup for those who care...</p>

<p>I didn't know what this was beforehand. They are called Jordan Spreaders. They were originally used to spread ballast along the tracks, but are also used to plow snow. Here is the Wikipedia link if you want the full history: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreader_(railroad)"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreader_(railroad)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreader_(railroad)</a>. The pictures below are much better views of what spreaders look like with lots of retractable blades.</p>
